This file contains message digests of all files listed in MANIFEST,
signed via the Module::Signature module, version $VERSION.

To verify the content in this distribution, first make sure you have
Module::Signature installed, then type:

    % cpansign -v

It will check each file's integrity, as well as the signature's
validity.  If "==> Signature verified OK! <==" is not displayed,
the distribution may already have been compromised, and you should
not run its Makefile.PL or Build.PL.

=head1 NAME

Module::Signature - Module signature file manipulation

=head1 VERSION

This document describes a modified version of B<Module::Signature>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Don't worry about this -- this module isn't functional.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Module::Signature> adds cryptographic authentications to CPAN
distributions, via the special F<SIGNATURE> file.

It currently has dependency and newline troubles on win32, so this stub 
file is bundled with Win32 to allow Bundle::CPAN to install without error.

Until it's removed from the CPAN bundle, this file provides a mock interface
with a sufficiently high VERSION to prevent CPAN from attempting to install
it when upgrading a Bundle

Its mock functionality will falsify a "missing signature" response for
all queries.  Signing will falsely succeed, but give a warning.
