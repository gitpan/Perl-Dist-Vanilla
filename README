NAME
    Perl::Dist::Vanilla - Vanilla Perl for win32

DESCRIPTION
    Vanilla Perl is an experimental Perl distribution for the Microsoft
    Windows platform that includes a bundled compiler. Vanilla Perl provides
    a Win32 installation of Perl that is as close as possible to the core
    Perl distrubution, while offering the ability to install XS CPAN modules
    directly from CPAN. Vanilla Perl aims to include only the smallest
    possible changes from the Perl core necessary to achieve this goal.

    Vanilla Perl includes:

    *   Perl 5.10.0

    *   Mingw GCC C/C++ compiler

    *   Dmake "make" tool

    Vanilla Perl is intended for use by automated testing systems and
    master-level Perl developers. The primary anticipated uses for Vanilla
    Perl include examining Win32-related issues in the Perl core, and for
    working on fixing complex dependency and Win32 platform bugs in CPAN
    modules.

    Vanilla Perl will eventually serve as the basis for additional Win32
    Perl distributions that include incremental bundled capabilities for
    general application development or application deployment needs.

    Vanilla Perl is strongly not recommended for general use on Win32
    platforms at this time for any purpose other than detecting and fixing
    bugs in Vanilla Perl and testing Win32 compatibility of various CPAN
    modules.

    Vanilla Perl will undergo changes without notice over time in an attempt
    to intentionally provoke errors and uncover problems close to the Perl
    core, so users should expect that it may unexpectedly display strange
    behaviours and various other problems.

    The Perl::Dist::Vanilla distribution on CPAN contains scripts and
    instructions for downloading component sources and assembling them into
    the executable installer for Vanilla Perl. It does not include the
    resulting Vanilla Perl installation itself.

    See "DOWNLOADING THE INSTALLER" for instructions on where to download
    and how to install Vanilla Perl.

    See Perl::Dist::Build at <http://search.cpan.org> for details on the
    builder used to create Vanilla Perl from source.

CHANGES FROM CORE PERL
    Vanilla Perl is and will continue to be based on the latest "stable"
    release of Perl, currently version 5.10.0.

    For the 5.10.0 series, no additional modules are installed.

    A stub CPAN Config.pm file is installed. It provides defaults to the
    path for dmake, to automatically follow dependencies and to use the
    Windows temporary directory for the CPAN working directory.

DOWNLOADING THE INSTALLER
    Vanilla Perl Builds from 4 on are available from
    <http://vanillaperl.com/>.

    Earlier builds of Vanilla Perl are available on Sourceforge.net as part
    of the Camelpack project: <http://camelpack.sourceforge.net/>

CONFIGURATION
    At present, the installation criteria for Vanilla Perl are quite strict.

    We hope to address some of these issues during the 5.10.1 timeline to
    make things a bit more flexible.

    Sorry :(

    Vanilla cannot co-exist with any other Perl installations at this time.

    You should remove any other Perl installations before installing Vanilla
    Perl.

    Vanilla Perl must be installed in C:\vanilla.

    Vanilla Perl 5.10.0 Build 9 comes in .zip format. Availability of an
    .exe installer has regressed while .exe creation undergoes a rewrite.

    Once installed, you should add to the following environment variables.

        * add directories to PATH
            - C:\vanilla\c\bin
            - C:\vanilla\perl\bin 

        * add directories to LIB
            - C:\vanilla\c\lib
            - C:\vanilla\perl\bin

        * add directories to INCLUDE 
            - C:\vanilla\c\include 
            - C:\vanilla\perl\lib\CORE 

    LIB and INCLUDE changes are likely more than are necessary, but attempt
    to head off potential problems compiling external programs for use with
    Perl and various CPAN modules.

    The first time that the "cpan" program is run, users will be prompted
    for configuration settings. You can go with the defaults if you wish,
    although since Vanilla is for experts only, you should probably
    configure manually.

    Manual CPAN configuration may be repeated by running the following
    command:

        perl -MCPAN::FirstTime -e "CPAN::FirstTime::init"

CONTACTS AND BUGS REPORTING
    Currently, Vanilla Perl discussion is centered at win32.perl.org. New
    venues for discussion may be listed there.

    Please report bugs or feature requests using the CPAN Request Tracker.
