=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::Vanilla::Build - Building Vanilla Perl from scratch

=head1 VERSION

This document refers to Vanilla Perl Build 4.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Perl::Dist::Vanilla distribution on CPAN contains scripts and instructions
for downloading component sources and assembling them into the executable
installer for Vanilla Perl.  It B<does not> include the resulting Vanilla Perl
installation itself.  

This document describes the build process for generating a Vanilla Perl
executable installer.  

As of Build 4, this documentation is incomplete.  Common build components will
be refactored into a separate package soon and docs will be revised more 
completely at that time.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Perl::Dist::Vanilla requires an existing Win32 Perl installation to bootstrap
the installation process.  It also requires numerous modules for
the build scripts.  These modules are listed in the Perl::Dist::Vanilla 
META.yml.  Installing Perl::Dist::Vanilla will pick up all necessary
dependencies.

Perl::Dist::Vanilla also requires the free Inno Setup tool to create the 
executable installer.  Inno Setup can be downloaded from jrsoftware.org:

L<http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php>

=head1 BOOTSTRAPPING

Perl hard-codes @INC directories into the binary, making it difficult to
relocate on the fly.  As a result, Vanilla Perl needs to be built at 
C<< C:\vanilla-perl >>.  To use Perl::Dist::Vanilla, a separate perl
installation must be available on the same machine.  Here is one way of 
boostrapping to that point, assuming no Perl already exists on the
computer in question:

=over

=item *

Download a Vanilla Perl executable installer and install it.  It will be
located at C<< C:\vanilla-perl >>.  

=item *

Install the Perl::Dist::Vanilla tarball from CPAN to pick up all dependencies.

=item *

Download a separate copy of the Perl::Dist::Vanilla tarball to access the
programs and extra files for the build process.  Unpack it and open a
command shell in that directory.

=item *

Edit C<< vanilla.yml >> and change the "image_dir" parameter to a different
path, e.g. C<< C:\bootstrap-perl >> for this example.

=item *

Run C<< perl bin\full_build.pl >>, which will build and install a
Vanilla Perl installation at that location.  (See the next section for
details.)

=item *

Edit the PATH, LIB, and INCLUDE environment variables to refer to 
C<< bootstrap-perl >> instead of C<< vanilla-perl >>.

=item *

Install the Perl::Dist::Vanilla tarball from CPAN to pick up all dependencies
again, this time installed in the fresh C<< bootstrap-perl >>.

=item *

Change the C<< vanilla.yml >> image_dir parameter back to 
C<< C:\vanilla-perl >>.

=back

At this point, the perl located at C<< C:\bootstrap-perl >> will be the default
perl and will not be affected by rebuilding a new Vanilla Perl at 
C<< vanilla-perl >>.  

=head1 BUILDING THE INSTALLATION SOURCE DIRECTORY

From the Perl::Dist::Vanilla tarball directory, the C<< bin\full_build.pl >>
program will build a full Vanilla Perl installation, just as in the
bootstrap process.  This includes:

=over

=item *

Downloading binary packages for dmake and MinGW gcc and unpacking them
to the right locations.

=item *

Downloading Perl source, building it and installing it.

=item *

Downloading additional Perl modules from CPAN and installing them (or 
portions of them).

=item *

Copying all license files and additional files to the correct locations.

=back

These processes are controlled from the C<< vanilla.yml >> file (which
will be documented in a subsequent release).

=head1 PACKAGING AS AN EXECUTABLE INSTALLER

Vanilla Perl is currently bundled into an executable installer with the
Inno Setup program using the included C<< perl.iss >> script.  The 
script controls the name and location of the executable.

To create the .exe file, open C<< perl.iss >> in Inno Setup and compile it.

=head1 CONTACTS AND BUGS REPORTING

Currently, Vanilla Perl discussion is centered at win32.perl.org.  New 
venues for discussion may be listed there.
